## Lab 3: Network Flows

### Set up environment

In Python 3

For `Anaconda` user:
1. Set up a virtual Python environment: `conda create --name myenv`, `conda activate myenv`
2. Install Python dependencies: `conda install --file requirements.txt`

If you are using `pip`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install libraries.

### Run the result
1. Start Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. See Sampling task in `sampling.ipynb`
3. See Sketching task in `sketching.ipynb`
4. See Flow data discretization task and Botnet profiling task in `discretization.ipynb`
5. See Flow classification task in `flow_classification.ipynb`
